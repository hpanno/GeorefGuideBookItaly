####Generating your Layout

Once you have your data styled and basemap added to your data view, we'll use Print Composer to apply an appropriate layout. This is the equivilant interface as the layout view in ArcGIS.
  - Project > New Print Composer > Create a Name for your Map in the 'Composer title' dialog box.
  - Once the blank layout has appeared > Layout > Add Map > Click and Drag to create the space in which you would like your map to render on the layout display. 
  - Select from the Presets drop down on the 'Page Size' section (right hand side of screen) > ANSI E (34x44in) or the page size appropriate for your project.
  - Export Settings > Export Resolution = 300dpi

####Adding Title Blocks, North Arrow, Logos, Legend, and Scale

Add a Title Block by selecting the 'Add Shape' icon on the left side of the Print Composer panel. Click and drag your box, adjust as necessary; add Title and descriptive text to your Title Block.

The logo will be populated in your map as an image. Select the 'Add Image' icon on the left side of the Print Composer panel. Click and drag the cursor to create the space in which your logo will inhibit. This box will be empty initially. Click on the 'Item Properties' tab > 'Main Properties' select the browse box and navigate to the img of your logo to populate the space.

The north arrow will be populated in the same manner as the logo was. However, when you get to 'Item properties' you have soem options. If you have a custom north arrow saved as an image file you would proceed to the browse box, much like you did in the logo step, and select your north arrow. If you do not have a custom image you can use a preloaded north arrow. Select from the options available in the 'Seach directories' tab. 

Add a legend by selecting the 'Add New Legend' icon on the left side of the Print Composer screen. Click and drag the marquee to create the space in which your legend will exist. The legend will default to list every item in your Table of Contents regardless if the layer is on or not. This can all be adjusted in the 'Item properties' tab on the right hand side of the screen.
