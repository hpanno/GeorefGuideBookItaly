####Generating your Layout

Once you have your data styled and basemap added to your data view, we'll use Print Composer to apply an appropriate layout. This is the equivilant interface as the layout view in ArcGIS.
  - Project > New Print Composer > Create a Name for your Map in the 'Composer title' dialog box.
  - Once the blank layout has appeared > Layout > Add Map > Click and Drag to create the space in which you would like your map to render on the layout display. 
  - Select from the Presets drop down on the 'Page Size' section (right hand side of screen) > ANSI E (34x44in) or the page size appropriate for your project.
  - Export Settings > Export Resolution = 300dpi

####Adding Title Blocks, North Arrow, Logos, Legend, and Scale

Add a Title Block by selecting the 'Add Shape' icon on the left side of the Print Composer panel. Click and drag your box, adjust as necessary; add Title and descriptive text to your Title Block.

The north arrow and logo will be placed in the map as images. Select the 'Add Image' icon on the left side of the Print Composer panel. Click and drag the cursor to create the space in which your north arrow (or logo) will inhibit. This box will be empty initially. Click on the 'Item Properties' tab > 'Main Properties' select the browse box and navigate to the img of your north arrow (or logo) to populate the space.

Add a legend by selecting the 'Add New Legend' icon on the left side of the Print Composer screen. Click and drag the marquee to create the space in which your legend will exist. The legend will default to list every item in your Table of Contents regardless if the layer is on or not. This can all be adjusted in the 'Item properties' tab on the right hand side of the screen.
